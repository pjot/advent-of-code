Solved this one with pen and paper. I'll try to follow the reasoning I used when I came up with the solution.

I noticed the input program repeats the same form 14 times, once per input digit:

```
inp w
mul x 0
add x z
mod x 26
div z <a>
add x <b>
eql x w
eql x 0
mul y 0
add y 25
mul y x
add y 1
mul z y
mul y 0
add y w
add y <c>
mul y x
add z y
```
Translating to python and reducing yields
```
def f(w, z, a, b, c):
    x = z % 26 + b
    z = z // a

    if x != w:
        z = z * 26 + w + c
    return z
```
where the parameters `a,` `b` and `c` change between repeats and can be extracted from the input file:
```
 _a____b____c_
  1   14   16
  1   11    3
  1   12    2
  1   11    7
 26  -10   13
  1   15    6
 26  -14   10
  1   10   11
 26   -4    6
 26   -3    5
  1   13   11
 26   -3    4
 26   -9    4
 26  -12    6
```
The output of running all instructions with a given set of input numbers (`W = [w0, w1, ... , 13]`) is something like:
```
def evaluate(W):
    z = 0
    for i, w in enumerate(W):
        a, b, c = parameters[i]
        z = f(w, z, a, b, c)
    return z
```
We want the value of `z` to end up at 0 at the end, but the only way for `z` to shrink is when we divide it by `a` in `f()`. This means there are two kinds of iterations, ones where `a = 1` where the division is a noop and ones where `a = 26` where we divide. All iterations multiplies `z` by 26 as well though, unless `x = w`. Some things to note:
 * `x` will always be `>= b`
 * `w` will always be `< 10`

All iterations where `a = 1` also have `b > 10`, leading to the following reasoning:
```
    b > 10  =>  x > 10  =>  x != w
```
meaning we will _always_ increase `z` during these iterations. The others all have `b < 0`, which makes `x = w` possible. In total there are 7 `1`-iterations and 7 `26`-iterations. Because 1-iterations will all make `z` ~26 times larger, the 26-iterations all need to have `x = w` in order to have `z = 0` at the end. At this point I followed the iterations from 0 to 13, keeping track of what constraints `x = w` set on the input number `W`. While writing this down I noticed that it made sense to keep track of `z` in the form `sum(a * 26^n)`:
```
            26   26^2   26^3   26^4
   z0 =  w0+16
   z1 =   w1+3  w0+16
   z2 =   w2+2   w1+3  w0+16  
   z3 =   w3+7   w2+2   w1+3  w0+16  
```
These have all been 1-iterations which are simple. For the 26-iterations I just assume I'm able to have `x = w` which makes `f(z) = floor(z / 26)`, essentially lowering the n-exponent on each term.
```
*  z4 =   w2+2   w1+3  w0+16  
   z5 =   w5+6   w2+2   w1+3  w0+16  
*  z6 =   w2+2   w1+3  w0+16  
   z7 =  w7+11   w2+2   w1+3  w0+16  
*  z8 =   w2+2   w1+3  w0+16  
*  z9 =   w1+3  w0+16  
  z10 = w10+11   w1+3  w0+16  
* z11 =   w1+3  w0+16  
* z12 =  w0+16
* z13 =      0
```
The ones marked with a star (`*`) is where we have a `x = w` condition. In general
```
    x = z(n-1) % 26 + b(n) for z(n)
```
where `z(n) % 26` is just the coefficient in the 26-column of the above table. The number `W` is the biggest when the lower indexed `w` is as big as possible while the other one is `< 10`.
```
                                                                W
 z4:  z3 % 26 - 10 = w4
       w3 + 7 - 10 = w4   =>   w4 + 3 = w3 = 9   =>   w4 = 6    ...96.........

 z6 : z5 % 26 - 14 = w6
       w5 + 6 - 14 = w6   =>   w6 + 8 = w5 = 9   =>   w6 = 1    ...9691.......

 z8:   z7 % 26 - 4 = w8
       w7 + 11 - 4 = w8   =>   w7 + 7 = w8 = 9   =>   w7 = 2    ...969129.....

 z9:   z8 % 26 - 3 = w9
        w2 + 2 - 3 = w9   =>   w9 + 1 = w2 = 9   =>   w9 = 8    ..99691298....

z11:  z10 % 26 - 3 = w11
      w10 + 11 - 3 = w11  =>  w10 + 8 = w11 = 9  =>  w10 = 1    ..9969129819..

z12:  z11 % 26 - 9 = w12
        w1 + 3 - 9 = w12  =>  w12 + 6 = w1 = 9   =>  w12 = 3    .999691298193.

z13: z12 % 26 - 12 = w13
      w0 + 16 - 12 = w13  =>   w0 + 4 = w13 = 9  =>   w0 = 5    59996912981939
```
Thus, the biggest `W = 59996912981939`. Similarly, the smallest `W = 17241911811915` (same procedure but make the lowered indexed `w` as small as possible while the other one is `> 0`.
